# todo-universal
This is a project to show how universal works
Clone the project
run `npm i` inside the project
after that, run `ng serve --port 4300` and `npm run dev:ssr`
You will have the same roject served, the one on the port 4200 will be the one server side rendered and the one on the port 4300 will be the client side rendered
You can see the difference by clicking 'view page source'
